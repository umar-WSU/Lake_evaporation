# Lake_evaporation
# We calculated evaporation (E) from global lakes using the Penman method (PM) and the Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator (LISSS) within the Community Land Model (CLM) from 2001 to 2016. The PM E aided with the equilibrium temperature approach is calculated at a monthly timescale. The LISSS simulates surface energy budget components at 30-min resolution, which are then aggregated to monthly product for comparison purpose. In addition to using the equilibrium temperature approach, the PM E is also determined by adopting Rn and G from the LISSS outputs, referred to as PM-LISSS E. The mean seasonal (summer and autumn) data of E, Rn, and G is provided here. Note that the seasons are synchronized for both Hemispheres. The summer is defined as June-August in the Northern Hemisphere and December-February in the Southern Hemisphere.
